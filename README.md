# Secret-Santa-Generator
A program that reads a .txt file with a list of names and email addresses and shuffles them and sends each person a message with the name of the person they will give a gift to.

For it to work you need a gmail account and if you have 2FA, you need an app password for this project. You need to format the participant's file like the template for it to work.

There also can't be any other dollar signs in the message or it will return an error.

Other than this you just have to run the program with idle and it should work.
